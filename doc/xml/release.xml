    <description>The {[project]} Releases detail each version of the software and lists the changes made in each version.</description>

    <intro>
        <text><backrest/> release numbers consist of two parts, major and minor.  A major release <i>may</i> break compatibility with the prior major release, but <proper>v2</proper> releases are fully compatible with <proper>v1</proper> repositories and will accept all <proper>v1</proper> options.  Minor releases can include bug fixes and features but do not change the repository format and strive to avoid changing options and naming.

        Documentation for the <proper>v1</proper> release can be found <link url="{[backrest-url-base]}/1">here</link>.

        The notes for a release may also contain <quote>Additional Notes</quote> but changes in this section are only to documentation or the test suite and have no direct impact the on the <backrest/> codebase.</text>

                        <p>Fix issue where <i>relative</i> links in <path>$PGDATA</path> could be stored in the backup with the wrong path.  This issue did not affect absolute links and relative tablespace links were caught by other checks.</p>

                        <p>Allow any option to be set in an environment variable.  This includes options that previously could only be specified on the command line, e.g. <br-option>stanza</br-option>, and secret options that could not be specified on the command-line, e.g. <br-option>repo1-s3-key-secret</br-option>.</p>

                        <p>Exclude temporary and unlogged relation (table/index) files from backup.  Implemented using the same logic as the patches adding this feature to <postgres/>, <link url="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/8694cc96b52a967a49725f32be7aa77fd3b6ac25">8694cc96</link> and <link url="https://git.postgresql.org/pg/commitdiff/920a5e500a119b03356fb1fb64a677eb1aa5fc6f">920a5e50</link>.  Temporary relation exclusion is enabled in <postgres/> &amp;ge; <id>9.0</id>.  Unlogged relation exclusion is enabled in <postgres/> &amp;ge; <id>9.1</id>, where the feature was introduced.</p>

                        <p>Allow arbitrary directories and/or files to be excluded from a backup.  Misuse of this feature can lead to inconsistent backups so read the <br-option>--exclude</br-option> documentation carefully before using.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Validate configuration options in a single pass.  By pre-calculating and storing the option dependencies in <file>parse.auto.c</file> validation can be completed in a single pass, which is both simpler and faster.</p>
                    </release-item>

                        <p>Improve performance of string to int conversion.  Use <code>strtoll()</code> instead of <code>sprintf()</code> for conversion.  Also use available integer min/max constants rather than hard-coded values.</p>

                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Allow <code>Buffer</code> object <quote>used size</quote> to be different than <quote>allocated size</quote>.  Add functions to manage used size and remaining size and update automatically when possible.</p>

                        <p>Abstract IO layer out of the storage layer.  This allows the routines to be used for IO objects that do not have a storage representation.  Implement buffer read and write IO objects.  Implement filters and update <code>cryptoHash</code> to use the new interface.  Implement size and buffer filters.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p><code>storageFileRead()</code> accepts a buffer for output rather than creating one.  This is more efficient overall and allows the caller to specify how many bytes will be read on each call.  Reads are appended if the buffer already contains data but the buffer size will never increase.</p>

                        <p>Manifest improvements.  Require <postgres/> catalog version when instantiating a <code>Manifest</code> object (and not loading it from disk).  Prevent manifest from being built more than once.  Limit manifest build recursion (i.e. links followed) to sixteen levels to detect link loops.</p>

                        <p>Refactor the <code>common/log</code> tests to not depend on <code>common/harnessLog</code>.  <code>common/harnessLog</code> was not ideally suited for general testing and made all the tests quite awkward.  Instead, move all code used to test the <code>common/log</code> module into the <code>logTest</code> module and repurpose <code>common/harnessLog</code> to do log expect testing for all other tests in a cleaner way. Add a few exceptions for config testing since the log levels are reset by default in <code>config/parse</code>.</p>

                        <p>Add <setting>--log-level-test</setting> option.  This allows setting the test log level independently from the general test harness setting, but current only works for the C tests.  It is useful for seeing log output from functions on the console while a test is running.</p>

        <release date="2018-07-05" version="2.04" title="Critical Bug Fix for Backup Resume">
            <release-core-list>
                <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This release fixes a critical bug in the backup resume feature. All resumed backups prior to this release should be considered inconsistent. A backup will be resumed after a prior backup fails, unless <br-option>resume=n</br-option> has been specified. A resumed backup can be identified by checking the backup log for the message <quote>aborted backup of same type exists, will be cleaned to remove invalid files and resumed</quote>. If the message exists, do not use this backup or any backup in the same set for a restore and check the restore logs to see if a resumed backup was restored. If so, there may be inconsistent data in the cluster.</p>

                        <p>Add asynchronous, parallel <cmd>archive-get</cmd>.  This feature maintains a queue of WAL segments to help reduce latency when <postgres/> requests a WAL segment with <pg-option>restore_command</pg-option>.</p>

                        <p>Add support for additional <backrest/> configuration files in the directory specified by the <br-option>--config-include-path</br-option> option. Add <br-option>--config-path</br-option> option for overriding the default base path of the <br-option>--config</br-option> and <br-option>--config-include-path</br-option> option.</p>

                        <p>Make backup/restore path sync more efficient.  Scanning the entire directory can be very expensive if there are a lot of small tables.  The backup manifest contains the path list so use it to perform syncs instead of scanning the backup/restore path.</p>

                        <p>Make <path>backup.history</path> sync more efficient.  Only the <path>backup.history/[year]</path> directory was being synced, so check if the <path>backup.history</path> is newly created and sync it as well.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Move async forking and more error handling to C. The Perl process was exiting directly when called but that interfered with proper locking for the forked async process.  Now Perl returns results to the C process which handles all errors, including signals.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Improved lock implementation written in C.  Now only two types of locks can be taken: <id>archive</id> and <id>backup</id>.  Most commands use one or the other but the <cmd>stanza-*</cmd> commands acquire both locks.  This provides better protection than the old command-based locking scheme.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Storage object improvements.  Convert all functions to variadic functions.  Enforce read-only storage. Add <code>storageLocalWrite()</code> helper function.  Add <code>storageCopy()</code>, <code>storageExists()</code>, <code>storageMove()</code>, <code>storageNewRead()</code>/<code>storageNewWrite()</code>, <code>storagePathCreate()</code>, <code>storagePathRemove()</code>, <code>storagePathSync()</code>, and <code>storageRemove()</code>.  Add <code>StorageFileRead</code> and <code>StorageFileWrite</code> objects.  Abstract Posix driver code into a separate module. Call <code>storagePathRemove()</code> from the Perl Posix driver.</p>

                        <p>Improve <code>String</code> and <code>StringList</code> objects.  Add <code>strUpper()</code>, <code>strLower()</code>, <code>strLstExists()</code>, <code>strLstExistsZ()</code>, <code>strChr()</code>, <code>strSub()</code>, <code>strSubN()</code>, and <code>strTrunc()</code>.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Improve <code>Buffer</code> object.  Add <code>bufNewC()</code>, <code>bufEq()</code> and <code>bufCat()</code>.  Only reallocate buffer when the size has changed.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Add <code>pgControlInfo()</code> to read <file>pg_control</file> and determine the <postgres/> version.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Add <code>walSegmentNext()</code> and <code>walSegmentRange()</code>.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Error handling improvments.  Add <code>THROWP_</code>* macro variants for error handling.  These macros allow an <code>ErrorType</code> pointer to be passed and are required for functions that may return different errors based on a parameter.  Add <code>_FMT</code> variants for all <code>THROW</code> macros so format types are checked by the compiler.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Split <code>cfgLoad()</code> into multiple functions to make testing easier.  Mainly this helps with unit tests that need to do log expect testing.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Allow <code>MemContext</code> objects to be copied to a new parent.  This makes it easier to create objects and then copy them to another context when they are complete without having to worry about freeing them on error.  Update <code>List</code>, <code>StringList</code>, and <code>Buffer</code> to allow moves.  Update <code>Ini</code> and <code>Storage</code> to take advantage of moves.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Refactor <id>usec</id> to <id>msec</id> in <code>common/time.c</code>.  The implementation provides <id>usec</id> resolution but this is not needed in practice and it makes the interface more complicated due to the extra zeros.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Replace <code>THROW_ON_SYS_ERROR()</code> with <code>THROW_SYS_ERROR()</code>.  The former macro was hiding missing branch coverage for critical error handling.</p>

                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Split debug and assert code into separate headers.  Assert can be used earlier because it only depends on the error-handler and not logging.  Add <code>ASSERT()</code> macro which is preserved in production builds.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Cleanup C types.  Remove <code>typec.h</code>. Order all typdefs above local includes.</p>

Since <backrest/> would not pass secure options on to sub-processes an obscure error was thrown.  The new error is much clearer and provides hints about how to fix the problem.  Update command documentation to omit secure options that cannot be specified on the command-line.</p>

                        <p>Improve performance of HTTPS client.  Buffering now takes the <code>pending</code> bytes on the socket into account (when present) rather than relying entirely on <code>select()</code>.

        <release date="2018-07-05" version="1.29" title="Critical Bug Fix for Backup Resume">
            <release-core-list>
                <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This release fixes a critical bug in the backup resume feature. All resumed backups prior to this release should be considered inconsistent. A backup will be resumed after a prior backup fails, unless <br-option>resume=n</br-option> has been specified. A resumed backup can be identified by checking the backup log for the message <quote>aborted backup of same type exists, will be cleaned to remove invalid files and resumed</quote>. If the message exists, do not use this backup or any backup in the same set for a restore and check the restore logs to see if a resumed backup was restored. If so, there may be inconsistent data in the cluster.</p>

                         <p>Improve the HTTP client to set <id>content-length</id> to 0 when not specified by the server.  S3 (and gateways) always set <id>content-length</id> or <id>transfer-encoding</id> but <id>HTTP 1.1</id> does not require it and proxies (e.g. <proper>HAProxy</proper>) may not include either.</p>

                        <p>Improve performance of HTTPS client.  Buffering now takes the <code>pending</code> bytes on the socket into account (when present) rather than relying entirely on <code>select()</code>.  In some instances the final bytes would not be flushed until the connection was closed.</p>

                     <release-item>
                         <p>Make backup/restore path sync more efficient.  Scanning the entire directory can be very expensive if there are a lot of small tables.  The backup manifest contains the path list so use it to perform syncs instead of scanning the backup/restore path.  Remove recursive path sync functionality since it is no longer used.</p>

                        <p>Fixed an issue retrieving WAL for old database versions.  After a <cmd>stanza-upgrade</cmd> it should still be possible to restore backups from the previous version and perform recovery with <cmd>archive-get</cmd>.  However, archive-get only checked the most recent db version/id and failed.  Also clean up some issues when the same db version/id appears multiple times in the history.</p>

                        <p>Fixed an issue with invalid backup groups being set correctly on restore.  If the backup cannot map a group to a name it stores the group in the manifest as <id>false</id> then uses either the owner of $PGDATA to set the group during restore or failing that the group of the current user.  This logic was not working correctly because the selected group was overwriting the user on restore leaving the group undefined and the user incorrectly set to the group.</p>

            <release-core-list>
                <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: The new implementation of asynchronous archiving no longer copies WAL to a separate queue. If there is any WAL left over in the old queue after upgrading to <id>1.13</id>, it will be abandoned and <b>not</b> pushed to the repository.

                To prevent this outcome, stop archiving by setting <setting>archive_command = false</setting>. Next, drain the async queue by running <code>pgbackrest --stanza=[stanza-name] archive-push</code> and wait for the process to complete.  Check that the queue in <path>[spool-path]/archive/[stanza-name]/out</path> is empty. Finally, install <code>1.13</code> and restore the original <setting>archive_command</setting>.

                <b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: The <cmd>stanza-create</cmd> command is not longer optional and must be executed before backup or archiving can be performed on a <b>new</b> stanza.  Pre-existing stanzas do not require <cmd>stanza-create</cmd> to be executed.</p>

            <release-core-list>
                 <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: In prior releases it was possible to specify options on the command-line that were invalid for the current command without getting an error.  An error will now be generated for invalid options so it is important to carefully check command-line options in your environment to prevent disruption.</p>

                        </release-item-contributor-list>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where options that were invalid for the specified command could be provided on the command-line without generating an error.  The options were ignored and did not cause any change in behavior, but it did lead to some confusion.  Invalid options will now generate an error.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed an issue where internal symlinks were not being created for tablespaces in the repository.  This issue was only apparent when trying to bring up clusters in-place manually using filesystem snapshots and did not affect normal backup and restore.</p>
                    </release-item>

                        </release-item-contributor-list>

                        <p>Fixed an issue that prevented errors from being output to the console before the logging system was initialized, i.e. while parsing options. Error codes were still being returned accurately so this would not have made a process look like it succeeded when it did not.</p>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where the <br-option>db-port</br-option> option specified on the backup server would not be properly passed to the remote unless it was from the first configured database.</p>

                        </release-item-contributor-list>

                        <p>Added the <br-option>--checksum-page</br-option> option to allow pgBackRest to validate page checksums in data files when checksums are enabled on <postgres/> >= 9.3.  Note that this functionality requires a C library which may not initially be available in OS packages.  The option will automatically be enabled when the library is present and checksums are enabled on the cluster.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Added the <br-option>--repo-link</br-option> option to allow internal symlinks to be suppressed when the repository is located on a filesystem that does not support symlinks.  This does not affect any <backrest/> functionality, but the convenience link <path>latest</path> will not be created and neither will internal tablespace symlinks, which will affect the ability to bring up clusters in-place manually using filesystem snapshots.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Added the <br-option>--repo-sync</br-option> option to allow directory syncs in the repository to be disabled for file systems that do not support them, e.g. NTFS.</p>

                        <p>Added a predictable log entry to signal that a command has completed successfully. For example a backup ends successfully with: <code>INFO: backup command end: completed successfully</code>.</p>

                        <p>For simplicity, the <file>pg_control</file> file is now copied with the rest of the files instead of by itself of at the end of the process.  The <cmd>backup</cmd> command does not require this behavior and the <cmd>restore</cmd> copies to a temporary file which is renamed at the end of the restore.</p>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where <id>keep-alives</id> could be starved out by lots of small files during multi-threaded <cmd>backup</cmd>.  They were also completely absent from single/multi-threaded <cmd>backup</cmd> resume and <cmd>restore</cmd> checksumming.</p>

                        <p>Fixed an issue where the <cmd>expire</cmd> command would refuse to run when explicitly called from the command line if the <br-option>db-host</br-option> option was set.  This was not an issue when <cmd>expire</cmd> was run automatically after a <cmd>backup</cmd></p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed an issue where validation was being running on <pg-setting>archive_command</pg-setting> even when the <br-option>archive-check</br-option> option was disabled.</p>

                        <p>Added <cmd>check</cmd> command to validate that <backrest/> is configured correctly for archiving and backups.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Added the <br-option>protocol-timeout</br-option> option.  Previously <br-option>protocol-timeout</br-option> was set as <br-option>db-timeout</br-option> + 30 seconds.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Failure to shutdown remotes at the end of the backup no longer throws an exception.  Instead a warning is generated that recommends a higher <br-option>protocol-timeout</br-option>.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Experimental support for non-exclusive backups in <postgres/> 9.6 beta2.  Changes to the control/catalog/WAL versions in subsequent betas may break compatibility but <backrest/> will be updated with each release to keep pace.</p>
                    </release-item>

                <release-improvement-list>
                    <release-item>
                        <p>Improved handling of users/groups captured during backup that do not exist on the restore host.  Also explicitly handle the case where user/group is not mapped to a name.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Option handling is now far more strict.  Previously it was possible for a command to use an option that was not explicitly assigned to it.  This was especially true for the <br-option>backup-host</br-option> and <br-option>db-host</br-option> options which are used to determine locality.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>The <code>pg_xlogfile_name()</code> function is no longer used to construct WAL filenames from LSNs. While this function is convenient it is not available on a standby.  Instead, the archive is searched for the LSN in order to find the timeline.  If due to some misadventure the LSN appears on multiple timelines then an error will be thrown, whereas before this condition would have passed unnoticed.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Changed version variable to a constant.  It had originally been designed to play nice with a specific packaging tool but that tool was never used.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Recommended install location for <backrest/> modules is now <path>/usr/share/perl5</path> since <path>/usr/lib/perl5</path> has been removed from the search path in newer versions of Perl.</p>

                        <p>Fixed DTD search path that did not work properly when <setting>--doc-path</setting> was used.</p>

                    <release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed section names being repeated in the info output when multiple <br-option>--require</br-option> options depended on the same sections.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Fixed <backrest/> config sections being blank in the output when not loaded from cache.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Allow hidden options to be added to a command.  This allows certain commands (like <id>apt-get</id>) to be forced during the build without making that a part of the documentation.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Update TeX Live to 2016 version.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Major refactor of the test suite to make it more modular and object-oriented.  Multiple Docker containers can now be created for a single test to simulate more realistic environments.  Tests paths have been renamed for clarity.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Greatly reduced the quantity of Docker containers built by default.  Containers are only built for <postgres/> versions specified in <id>db-minimal</id> and those required to build documentation. Additional containers can be built with <br-option>--db-version=all</br-option> or by specifying a version, e.g. <br-option>--db-version=9.4</br-option>.</p>

                        <p>Upgraded doc/test VM to Ubuntu 16.04.  This will help catch Perl errors in the doc code since it is not run across multiple distributions like the core and test code. It is also to be hoped that a newer kernel will make Docker more stable.</p>

                        <p>Allow selective restore of databases from a cluster backup.  This feature can result in major space and time savings when only specific databases are restored.  Unrestored databases will not be accessible but must be manually dropped before they will be removed from the shared catalogue.</p>

         <release date="2016-04-14" version="1.00" title="New Repository Format and Configuration Scheme, Link Support">
             <release-core-list>
                 <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This flag day release breaks compatibility with older versions of <backrest/>.  The manifest format, on-disk structure, configuration scheme, and the exe/path names have all changed.  You must create a new repository to hold backups for this version of <backrest/> and keep your older repository for a time in case you need to do a restore.  Restores from the prior repository will require the prior version of <backrest/> but because of name changes it is possible to have <id>1.00</id> and a prior version of <backrest/> installed at the same time.  See the notes below for more detailed information on what has changed.</p>

                        <p>Implemented a new configuration scheme which should be far simpler to use.  See the User Guide and Configuration Reference for details but for a simple configuration all options can now be placed in the <setting>stanza</setting> section. Options that are shared between stanzas can be placed in the <setting>[global]</setting> section.  More complex configurations can still make use of command sections though this should be a rare use case.</p>

                        <p>The <setting>repo-path</setting> option now always refers to the repository where backups and archive are stored, whether local or remote, so the <setting>repo-remote-path</setting> option has been removed.  The new <setting>spool-path</setting> option can be used to define a location for queueing WAL segments when archiving asynchronously.  A local repository is no longer required.</p>

            <release-core-list>
                <p><b>IMPORTANT BUG FIX FOR TABLESPACES</b>: A change to the repository format was accidentally introduced in 0.90 which means the on-disk backup was no longer a valid <postgres/> cluster when the backup contained tablespaces.  This only affected users who directly copied the backups to restore <postgres/> clusters rather than using the restore command.  However, the fix breaks compatibility with older backups that contain tablespaces no matter how they are being restored (<backrest/> will throw errors and refuse to restore).  New full backups should be taken immediately after installing version 0.91 for any clusters that contain tablespaces.  If older backups need to be restored then use a version of <backrest/> that matches the backup version.</p>

                <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This flag day release breaks compatibility with older versions of <backrest/>.  The manifest format, on-disk structure, and the binary names have all changed.  You must create a new repository to hold backups for this version of <backrest/> and keep your older repository for a time in case you need to do a restore.  The <file>pg_backrest.conf</file> file has not changed but you'll need to change any references to <file>pg_backrest.pl</file> in cron (or elsewhere) to <file>pg_backrest</file> (without the <file>.pl</file> extension).</p>

                        <p>Found and squashed a nasty bug where <code>file_copy()</code> was defaulted to ignore errors.  There was also an issue in <code>file_exists()</code> that was causing the test to fail when the file actually did exist.  Together they could have resulted in a corrupt backup with no errors, though it is very unlikely.</p>

This is not complete, but works well enough to find a few errors that have been causing us problems (notably, find is occasionally failing building the archive async manifest when system is under load).</p>

                        <p>The <cmd>archive-get</cmd> command now returns a 1 when the archive file is missing to differentiate from hard errors (ssh connection failure, file copy error, etc.)  This lets <postgres/> know that that the archive stream has terminated normally.

                        <p>If an archive directory which should be empty could not be deleted backrest was throwing an error.  There's a good fix for that coming, but for the time being it has been changed to a warning so processing can continue.  This was impacting backups as sometimes the final archive file would not get pushed if the first archive file had been in a different directory (plus some bad luck).</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>No restore functionality, but the backup directories are consistent <postgres/> data directories.  You'll need to either uncompress the files or turn off compression in the backup.  Uncompressed backups on a ZFS (or similar) filesystem are a good option because backups can be restored locally via a snapshot to create logical backups or do spot data recovery.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Archiving is single-threaded.  This has not posed an issue on our multi-terabyte databases with heavy write volume.  Recommend a large WAL volume or to use the async option with a large volume nearby.</p>
                    </release-item>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Backups are multi-threaded, but the <code>Net::OpenSSH</code> library does not appear to be 100% thread-safe so it will very occasionally lock up on a thread.  There is an overall process timeout that resolves this issue by killing the process.  Yes, very ugly.</p>

                    <release-item>
                        <p>Checksums are lost on any resumed backup. Only the final backup will record checksum on multiple resumes.  Checksums from previous backups are correctly recorded and a full backup will reset everything.</p>

                        <p>The <file>backup.manifest</file> is being written as <code>Storable</code> because <code>Config::IniFile</code> does not seem to handle large files well.  Would definitely like to save these as human-readable text.</p>
